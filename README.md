Linear and Non linear Model of univariate Time Series Data 

The task estimate and compare the performance of linear and nonlinear time series model that best fit a univariate time series data, using quarterly oil prices series of Nigeria from the period of (1981:Q1-2018:Q4). At first the task inspect the pattern of the series over the period of consideration using time series plot in order to observe the attribute present in the series, autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation function were conducted in the project to assess the efficiency of the series for stationarity assumption which was later ascertain in the project with Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) and Phillips Perros (PP). Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) were used for the linear model while Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and General Autoregressive Condition Heteroskedacity  (GARCH) where nonlinear model fitted for the series. Best model fit for the series was selected using Akiake Information Criterion (AIC) and other Criterion for both linear and nonlinear model of the series. The report shows that GARCH (1,1) of nonlinear model have the minimum AIC in comparison with their counterpart, which implies that GARCH (1,1) is best fit for the oil prices series. Hence, the study recommends that for a oil prices series data set, nonlinear model is the best model for accurate prediction, and also GARCH (1, 1) should be used for modeling and forecasting oil prices in Nigeria.
